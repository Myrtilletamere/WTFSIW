###<center>The App for lazy movie nights  
<br>

* The idea for *WTF Should I Watch* came from the very annoying situations I frequently find myself in: wanting to watch something, but not knowing what.

 * *WTF Should I Watch* is the new-found amazing **solution** to this almighty hellish **problem**. 

 * **No more** <s>endless scrolling</s> through an alphabeticelly-ordered list of movie titles in <s>vain hope</s> of finding ***the one*** - one who will stay by your side and make your evening an *unforgettable memory* you will look back upon, a single nostalgic tear slowly rolling on your cheek, and make your children wonder silently about your mysterious *yet* oddly cool past.

 * Get a first movie offer, and let yourself *go with the flow* to find **the** movie made for ***you*** tonight!

* Using the [RottenTomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/) API, *WTF Should I Watch* has **thousands of movies** in stores for you tonight, and a unique way to present them to you. Get a random proposition and refine the offers to your liking, of simply choose to be surprise and watch something random!
		
  * Save the movies you watched to your personnal database, mark those you want to find again later, and rate the movie you just watched!
  * TV Shows coming soon!
